# pySnakeGame
This is an implementation of the Snake game using Python! 
The main purpose of this project is to modify it later using threading and other crypto systems or stuff for communications. 
And, obviously, for having fun implementing it! :D

This project contains: 
  - Own python error handling
  - Multi-Class development
